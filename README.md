# PyBer_Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to gather ride sharing information from PyBers and compare the differences between Urban, Suburban, and Rural areas. In order to do so this information will be used to create tables, charts, and a graph that compares the weekly fares by city type.

## Results

Total rides, drivers, and fares were highest for Urban areas. However they had the lowest average fare per ride and lowest average fare per driver. The total number of Urban drivers exceeded the total number of rides from Urban areas. The total number of drivers for Suburban and Rural areas was less than the total number of rides from Suburban and Rural areas.

Over the 4 month period Urban areas had the most profit from fares, followed by Suburband and finally Rurlal areas.

### Summary

Based on the results from the ride sharing information I can provide 3 recommendations to PyBers CEO.

1. The average ride per fare is highest in Rural areas. This implies that the average ride is going over a longer distance; especially when compared to Urban areas. The distances of the rides in rural areas should be examined. If the rides are on average over a longer distance than more drivers will need to be added.

2. Since Rural areas has less people it might be hard to get more drivers from the area itself. Since Urban areas were the only area to have total drivers exceed total rides drivers from Urban areas may need to be incetivized to go to Rural areas to pick up the slack.

3. If  more Urban drivers were to go into Rural and Suburban areas this could help drive down the average fare per ride in Rural and Suburban Areas. If the cost of fares go down this could also encourage new riders and more drivers to start using PyBer. Increasing the total drivers and rides would also work to offset the decrease in average fare per ride.
